My past previous work from ICS 211 that contains all the assignments that I did into one big project. Some examples include:

Assignment 01:
README

@author: Na, Jonathan ICS-211 Section 01

Big-0 analysis:

Insertion sorting analysis:
Array[10] = 	sort time 66480 nanoseconds, 	compare 31, 	swaps 22
Array[100]= 	sort time 1291011 nanoseconds, 	compare 2700, 	swaps 2601
Array[1000]=	sort time 23738022 nanoseconds, compare 250734, swaps 249735

Bubble sorting analysis:
Array[10] = 	sort time 53348 nanoseconds, 	compare 45, 	swaps 23
Array[100]= 	sort time 1005806 nanoseconds, 	compare 4935, 	swaps 2736
Array[1000]=	sort time 27137083 nanoseconds, compare 498324, swaps 255473

Selection sorting analysis:
Array[10] = 	sort time 27495 nanoseconds, 	compare 45, 	swaps 9
Array[100]= 	sort time 556456 nanoseconds, 	compare 4950, 	swaps 99
Array[1000]=	sort time 19162853 nanoseconds, compare 499500, swaps 999

Analysis:
The selection sorting takes the longest time in comparing integers for both O(n),(compare: 4950) 
and O(n^2),(compare: 499500).
However it takes the least number of swaps out of all the sorting arrays however it has a
few difference in its best and worse case scenarios for both the O(n),(swaps: 99) 
and O(n^2),(swaps: 999) and O(1),(swaps: 9).

The bubble sorting is the best case when comparing and swaps at the O(n),(compare: 4935)
However its the worse sorting method when it hits the O(n^2),(compare: 4983324, swaps: 255473) 
also making it the worse case at of all the sorting methods. 

The insertion sorting is the best case at compares and swaps at O(1),(compare: 31) 
than the other 2 sorting methods
However it also starts to get worse at the O(n^2),(compare: 250734)but runs far better 
than the bubble sort and selection sort.

Conclusion:
In conclusion the best sorting method is the selection sorting method because it takes
the least amount of time, and the least number of swaps. Although it has the large number
of compares it still runs the fastest out of all the three sorting methods.


What will happen if your data array has nulls in it?
	I will get a runtime error: java.lang.NullPointerException
