This project is from an assignment done in ICS 111 for the final project. It uses Java coding with Object Oriented Programming with:
●	File reading: To hold information of images to be used
●	Arrays: To handle all the different graphics that will be used
●	Functions/Classes: Different graphics will require different behaviors

This project contained 3 group members:
●	Jess - Will write classes associated with animations
●	Jiaqi - Will write main program
●	Jonathan - Will write classes associated with interactive games

The final project came out to a video game in which you play as a musical note, as the song plays the lyrics fly across the screen
with random objects. Your job is to avoid all the lyrics and objects to survive the entire song.

<hr>

<pre>
Want to be part of the video?
Then use your keyboard to keep the video playing! Use your
keyboard to dodge the upcoming lyrics

<--------------------Instructions------------------------>
w = move forward    a = rotate left
s = move backward   d = rotate right
<------------------------------------------------>

START: To start the game press the spacebar button to start the game.

LOSING: You have 20 lives to start out, every time you touch a lyric you lose one life after 0 lives its game over.

WINNING: To win the game you must survive through the entire song

SONG: Lesson Learnt by Aaron Taylor

LYRICS:

You would've thought that our love be gone by now 
It seems that I'm here again, so where's my whole? 
Every time the same again comes back around 
If you don't learn to swim 
Then you'll sink, and then you'll drown, 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
Baby, you are burnt! 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
You will probably burn 

Is it my fault if I choose to let go? 
The things that you've told me once or twice before 
Maybe I'd probably not understand 
The things that I, I don't know as a man 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
Baby, you are burnt! 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
You will probably burn 

Want you to teach it to me 
Eh eh ehe eh eh 
Want you to teach it to me

This project is from an assignment done in ICS 491 for the 2017 annual HACC (hackathon). It uses Python coding with HTML, CSS and Javascript with:

●	Angular: A Javascript based open source fraemwork for front end applications

●	Atom: An IDE to create software. 

●	Bootstrap: Front end framework to design the website

●	Matplotlib: A plotting library to build 2D charts using Python

●	Highcharts: Interactive javascript library to build various different charts

This project contained 2 group members:

●	Jonathan

●	Vincent

The final project came out to a carpool app that the UH community could use to find other carpoolers in their area.

Our approach:

**Enabling Scene Designers to create BCI VR/Games with less Unity C# development**

This project is from participation for the 2018 BR41N.io hackathon. It uses Simulink and Unity:

●	Simulink: System simulation which auto-generate code for the program.

●	Unity: A development cross-platform game engine.

This project contained 3 other group members:

●	<a href="https://github.com/MauiJerry"><i class="large github icon "></i>Jerry Isdale</a>

●	<a href="https://github.com/zannorman"><i class="large github icon "></i>Charlie Zannorman</a>

● Josh Bross

We encapsulate BCI data streams in Unity ScriptableObjects enabling Scene Designers to compose applications in Unity Editor rather than coding C#.
