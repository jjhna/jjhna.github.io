This project is from an assignment done in ICS 111 for the final project. It uses Java coding with Object Oriented Programming with:
●	File reading: To hold information of images to be used
●	Arrays: To handle all the different graphics that will be used
●	Functions/Classes: Different graphics will require different behaviors

This project contained 3 group members:
●	Jess - Will write classes associated with animations
●	Jiaqi - Will write main program
●	Jonathan - Will write classes associated with interactive games

The final project came out to a video game in which you play as a musical note, as the song plays the lyrics fly across the screen
with random objects. Your job is to avoid all the lyrics and objects to survive the entire song. 

A video example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycJ7VrzlSDM

SONG: Lesson Learnt by Aaron Taylor

LYRICS:

You would've thought that our love be gone by now 
It seems that I'm here again, so where's my whole? 
Every time the same again comes back around 
If you don't learn to swim 
Then you'll sink, and then you'll drown, 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
Baby, you are burnt! 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
You will probably burn 

Is it my fault if I choose to let go? 
The things that you've told me once or twice before 
Maybe I'd probably not understand 
The things that I, I don't know as a man 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
Baby, you are burnt! 
I guess that's a lesson learnt! 
If you play with fire, 
You will probably burn 

Want you to teach it to me 
Eh eh ehe eh eh 
Want you to teach it to me
