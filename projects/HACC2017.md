This project is from an assignment done in ICS 491 for the 2017 annual HACC (hackathon). It uses Python coding with HTML, CSS and Javascript with:

●	Angular: A Javascript based open source fraemwork for front end applications

●	Atom: An IDE to create software. 

●	Bootstrap: Front end framework to design the website

●	Matplotlib: A plotting library to build 2D charts using Python

●	Highcharts: Interactive javascript library to build various different charts

This project contained 2 group members:

The final project came out to a carpool app that the UH community could use to find other carpoolers in their area.
