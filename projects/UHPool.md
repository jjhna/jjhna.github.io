This project is from an assignment done in ICS 314 for the final project. It uses Java coding with HTML with:
●	Meteor: An open source platform for web, mobile and desktop.
●	IntelliJ: A Java IDE to create software. 
●	Semantic UI: A website that gives professional user interface for websites.

This project contained 3 group members:
●	Jonathan
●	Zac
●	Joshua

The final project came out to a carpool app that the UH community could use to find other carpoolers in their area.
