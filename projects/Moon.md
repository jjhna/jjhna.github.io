Our approach:

**A VR game/simulator for a spaceship mission to reach the moon**

This is a class project for ICS 685: VR Development which uses the HTC VIVE and Unity:

●	VR Challenger Center Mission: Return to the Moon

●	Loosely based off the Challenger missions from the Challenger center.

●	Return to the Moon - Create a lunar base and search for Helium-3. Probe team searches for suitable landing spot from 2 choices. Navigation team tries to land in the chosen landing spot. 

●	This is done by implementing six essential features:
    1. Web Browser
    
    2. User Experience (UX)
    
    3. Menu Canvas
    
    4. Inventory System
    
    5. Virtual Navigation
    
    6. Stickies
    
This project contained 2 other group members:

●	Anna Sikkink

●	Aidai Almaz Kyzy


We imported free Unity assets for the game objects and used the C# coding to utilize the gameobjects to their full potential and to tie in game events.
