Our approach:

A VR game/simulator for a spaceship mission to reach the moon

This is a class project for ICS 685: VR Development which uses the HTC VIVE and Unity:

● VR Challenger Center Mission: Return to the Moon

● Loosely based off the Challenger missions from the Challenger center.

● Return to the Moon - Create a lunar base and search for Helium-3. Probe team searches for suitable landing spot from 2 choices. Navigation team tries to land in the chosen landing spot.

    We decided to create a modified version of the return to the moon mission, adding some changes to allow us to adapt the experience to VR. *

● There are two different stations in the challenger center missions: 1. Space Station (SS) - perform the tasks and mission 2. Mission Control - gives instructions and commands

● Half the team works on the SS and the other half for mission control. Similar to the game “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”, someone is attempting to solve a puzzle while another person is giving instructions and suggestions.

● Keeping it at a 20 minute experience, easy to learn for first time VR players

This project contained 2 other group members:

● Anna Sikkink

● Aidai Almaz Kyzy

We imported free Unity assets for the game objects and used the C# coding to utilize the gameobjects to their full potential and to tie in game events.
