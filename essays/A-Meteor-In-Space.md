*An infographic image on how Meteor works*

### Note: 
I orginally wrote this essay while I was on part 3 on digits (the due date was orginally sooner) but after completing the WOD review on Thursday my feelings towards Meteor has changed. I have added addtional thoughts in the After learning Digits section.

## Space Rock

The average speed of a meteor hitting earth is about 160,000 mph. Which is unsurprisingly the name of the open source platform to build websites. However, for the past two weeks instead of hitting Earth I felt more like a meteor stuck in space missing my target. I’ll admit that I wasn’t really impressed by meteor at first it just seemed like IntelliJ and semantic UI with more steps. However, throughout the week as we learned more about Meteor it became a little bit more interesting as we learned about the benefits of using Meteor such as instant updates, Mongo and how customers have their own little private server to retrieve part of a bigger server. So, I right now I feel like heading towards Earth but at a slow pace and hopefully reach it by next week. 
	
## Issues

Looking back at last week I noticed a lot of people were having issues with meteor and that’s only the portion of folks that had issues just trying to make it start. So, it’s no surprise or embarrassment that I also had some issues using Meteor and this is where I really started to hate Meteor. One of the issues that I faced was having a word misspelled in one of the Javascript file:
	
```
Changed: 
Template.Add_Contact_Page.events({
                                  
To:
Template.Edit_Contact_Page.events({

``` 

Just one little word from add to edit made my entire code running again. Another issue that I had was some sort of bcrypt warning code that I received while trying to run Meteor on Linux. It was an easy fix but I really hate to fix problems that I don’t know what’s going on. 

## Learning Curve

I did notice a huge learning curve to learn Meteor, once you get past one part and know what’s going on you can get a better understanding on how Meteor works. At the Meteor website, it says: “The fastest way to build Javascript Apps,” right now, I don’t agree with that statement but once I pass that learning curve I think I can appreciate Meteor more. I did enjoy how fast it instantly updates on the localhost website. Also, a lot of the template for the website is pretty much built into Semantic-UI and Meteor. All you really have to do is follow instructions and create a Javascript and HTML file. Unlike how I started out in the beginning with trying to fix the margin of the website heading Semantic-UI and Meteor has relieved some unnecessary steps to creating a website. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I can’t say a lot good things about Meteor, this is my first time building a website using Meteor and the first class to make a website in general. I’ll admit it’s hard trying to learn it but at the same time it makes it easy to avoid filtering around the heading, margins, and unnecessary items I have to change. I still have a lot to learn so I think I’ll keep my head up high as I go through the wonders (or torturous) path with Meteor. 

## After learning Digits:

I feel a lot more confident on what I'm doing with metoer and I feel like I'm entering the atmosphere of Earth at the moment. I'm haven't exactly hit Earth yet but I'm proud to say that I'm on the right track. I now feel like my previous issue that I had with the Javascript naming files is something of the past. I now made a chceklist to go through those problems and found the issue that I previously found annoying really easy. However I did discover new issues while coding through digits and the WOD.
