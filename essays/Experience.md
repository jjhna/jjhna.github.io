My expereince so far in computer science at UH Manoa

My experience so far in computer science at UH Manoa has been quite a ride. I had a lot of doubts when I first attended my first ICS 111 class with professor Jason Leigh. However quite to my surprise I found it very interesting. I especially remember him telling us in class that we will reach a point in coding where we hit a wall where it gets very difficult to climb over. I whole heartedly agree with this, during my time at UH Manoa I found myself facing walls to climb over instead of hills to climb. I faced even more trials when I got into ICS 211 and 241. I started to learn more about sorting methods and deeper analysis of the Big-O for each sort. Inductions and Recursions that were a bane to my existent and coding was becoming complex up until a point where I started to hate code. Yup, you heard that right I started to hate coding and I knew it was only going to get worse. Fortunately, I started to make new friends, classmates and TA’s that would help ease the struggle. Honestly if it wasn’t for these people I would’ve probably dropped this major and look somewhere else. I did imagine computer programmers to be working in a cubicle with little interactions with others but after this past year I think programmers are at their peak performance when they socialize with others. Unfortunately I’m back to school with harder classes and more unfamiliar faces in my class but I know that I’ll make new friends in class and by working together we can move forward over these walls.
