*An infographic image on how Meteor works*

# My thoughts on the HAAC 2017

"I don't want to present my project" - I thought to myself as I went on stage.
	
## Initial Thoughts



## Learning Curve

I did notice a huge learning curve to learn Meteor, once you get past one part and know what’s going on you can get a better understanding on how Meteor works. At the Meteor website, it says: “The fastest way to build JavaScript Apps,” right now, I don’t agree with that statement but once I pass that learning curve I think I can appreciate Meteor more. I did enjoy how fast it instantly updates on the localhost website. Also, a lot of the template for the website is pretty much built into Semantic-UI and Meteor. All you really must do is follow instructions and create a JavaScript and HTML file. Unlike how I started out in the beginning with trying to fix the margin of the website heading Semantic-UI and Meteor has relieved some unnecessary steps to creating a website. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I can’t say a lot good things about Meteor, this is my first time building a website using Meteor and the first class to make a website in general. I’ll admit it’s hard trying to learn it but at the same time it makes it easy to avoid filtering around the heading, margins, and unnecessary items I must change. I still have a lot to learn so I think I’ll keep my head up high as I go through the wonders (or torturous) path with Meteor. 

## After learning Digits:

I feel a lot more confident on what I'm doing with meteor and I feel like I'm entering the atmosphere of Earth now. I'm haven't exactly hit Earth yet but I'm proud to say that I'm on the right track. I now feel like my previous issue that I had with the JavaScript naming files is something of the past. I now made a checklist to go through those problems and found the issue that I previously found annoying easy. I really didn't have any further issues but what I did find annoying is the number of files that had to be tracked. For instance, creating a Home page meant that you had to keep track of a header, footer, index, etc. If a file didn't point to the correct file then it could create a blank webpage or send meteor crashing. After getting passed that initial learning curve meteor doesn't look so scary now and I can appreciate the efficiency of the automatic updates, publications and MongoDB. I hope by the time I finish up my final project with my group members I'll be a subject matter expert on Meteor.
