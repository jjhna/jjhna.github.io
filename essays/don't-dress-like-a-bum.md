#Don’t dress like a bum

19 Feb 2017

Picture programmer in suit

It’s a small joke but people will judge you based off how you look.

##What makes you look professional?

In every job that I’ve been too, a uniform was always required. Especially in the military where an ink stain on your uniform meant that you had to go buy a new one if you couldn’t wash it off. Looking back, it does make sense why a manager or boss would be so picky on the appearance of your uniform. Someone wearing casual clothes at formal affair or a dirty uniform at military formation. The same can be said for any websites, a skewed menu or bad resolution of the image on your website can make it look terrible. Which is why uniformity is important and the best thing about them is that they were already made and built and all you had to do was wear it. Which is the purpose of Semantic UI’s to keep your whole website look professional with a uniform that’s built for you. After all you don’t dress like a bum when you talk to your boss or customers. 

##Semantic UI’s vs Raw steak

Which do you prefer cooked steak or raw steak? Now I prefer my steak cooked well done and would prefer to order it since I’m bad at cooking steak. That’s what Semantic UI does for you it gives you the multiple options to how you want your steak vs committing the time to cook that steak and possibly mess it up. 

```
.left {
	  float: left;
	  width: 300px;
	  padding: 1em;
	}
	.right {
	  float: right;
	  width: 300px;
	  padding: 1em;
	}
	.center {
	  margin-left: 300px;
	  margin-right: 300px;
	  padding: 1em;
	  width: 300px;
	}

```
Seems like a lot of work just to affix some text or image

However, it’s not all roses and daisies for semantic UI. Time and effort is needed when you’re learning how to use it and not everything turns out perfect. For example, when I first started using Semantic UI I noticed a huge learning curve. So far, it’s the hardest thing I’m learning from this class (and I thought underscore was difficult). But if I do get pass this wall that I’m facing I’m sure that Semantic UI will help make my website look professional something that I’ll even have a harder time doing by myself. After all, you have a harder time cooking that raw steak that you may mess up on.
