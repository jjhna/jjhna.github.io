#Don’t dress like a bum
19 Feb 2017
Picture programmer in suit
It’s a small joke but people will judge you based off how you look.
##What makes you look professional?
In every job that I’ve been too, a uniform was always required. Especially in the military where an ink stain on your uniform meant that you had to go buy a new one if you couldn’t wash it off. Looking back, it does make sense why a manager or boss would be so picky on the appearance of your uniform. Someone wearing casual clothes at formal affair or a dirty uniform at military formation. The same can be said for any websites, a skewed menu or bad resolution of the image on your website can make it look terrible. Which is why uniformity is important and the best thing about them is that they were already made and built and all you had to do was wear it. Which is the purpose of Semantic UI’s to keep your whole website look professional with a uniform that’s built for you. After all you don’t dress like a bum when you talk to your boss or customers. 
##Semantic UI’s vs Raw steak
Which do you prefer cooked steak or raw steak? Now I prefer my steak cooked well done and would prefer to order it since I’m bad at cooking steak. That’s what Semantic UI does for you it gives you the multiple options to how you want your steak vs committing the time to cook that steak and possibly mess it up. 
```
.left {
	  float: left;
	  width: 300px;
	  padding: 1em;
	}
	.right {
	  float: right;
	  width: 300px;
	  padding: 1em;
	}
	.center {
	  margin-left: 300px;
	  margin-right: 300px;
	  padding: 1em;
	  width: 300px;
	}

```
Seems like a lot of work just to affix some text or image
However, it’s not all roses and daisies for semantic UI. Time and effort is needed when you’re learning how to use it and not everything turns out perfect. For example, when I first started using Semantic UI I noticed a huge learning curve. So far, it’s the hardest thing I’m learning from this class (and I thought underscore was difficult). But if I do get pass this wall that I’m facing I’m sure that Semantic UI will help make my website look professional something that I’ll even have a harder time doing by myself. After all, you have a harder time cooking that raw steak that you may mess up on. 
##The review
	I just started using semantic UI so I really can’t point out any pros or cons now. However, I did notice some reviews online that caught my attention: 

<blockquote>
CON Very large file size
Packages are much bigger when comparing to Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation. – thermoplastics and Mike, https://www.slant.co/options/520/~semantic-ui-review#pros

Which raised the question why don’t we use Twitter Bootstrap or this Zurb Foundation. Looking further into these two frameworks I noticed that they both look very professional. However, after digging even deeper I did find that there are some reasons why semantic UI is better at some parts that Twitter Bootstrap can’t do. For example, per this article: 
https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/twitter-bootstrap-vs-semantic-ui/ 
Semantic UI is more difficult, making things difficult now won’t make it easier later and it requires more Javascript which is something we’re all currently learning. The best thing about Semantic UI is that its user friendly when typing in code hence the name semantic. 
##Key Thoughts
Semantic UI is hard and it should be, nothing is easy in life and down the road things are only going to get difficult. In other words, it’s better to practice the hard stuff first so that if you come across it again it becomes easier. Just like wearing a uniform it can get annoying at first but down the road you begin to get used to it until it becomes a part of you.
