# Overview: UHPool

The problem: the parking situation for UH Manoa students and faculty is in dire need of restructure. Many students and faculty members (especially students) have a hard time getting hold of a parking pass on campus due to the limited parking.

## The solution: 
Carpooling is a great solution to the limited parking problem; however, many students usually commute to school by themselves. Per the UH Manoa Commuter Service the carpool minimum occupants need to be two people. By creating a system that allows UH students and faculty to find others that have similar schedules and similar living locations, the carpool system can be more efficient. To find someone else that’s looking for carpooling that person would have to go through the Department of Transportation Highways and submit a car/school pool matching form: http://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/carschool-pool-matching-form-submit/ and it only contains two forms to fill in the start and leave hours that’s assumingly only for every week. We all know that students and faculty staff have busy schedules in college and its harder to find a match with only two fields to fill in for the schedule. So, users can have additional carpoolers in their schedule, for example: person ‘A’ might have the same schedule as person ‘B’ for Mondays to Wednesdays so both party members would have to find another user to fill in their schedule. Also, students and faculty would prefer to find a match with someone else’s schedule and city before buying a carpool permit. 

UHPool requires a UH ID, and requires that the users, who are planning on driving, post the city in which they live in. That way other users can search for anyone that lives near their area. The initial website shows all other users name, city and home many occupants they can hold in their vehicle. When clicking on someone’s name on the listing the webpage will direct them to the user’s name, email address, car make and model, and school schedule on a posting. From there, the users can click a button that will notify the user that posted the listing that there is a possible match. After confirmation, has been sent between the user’s then additional information can be sent such as phone numbers and address (depends on user’s discretion). Or set up a meeting on campus to get to know the other user better before making any other decision.
