	“While many Americans and Europeans discovered the music in 2012, K-Pop artists have been performing and recording throughout the world since the 1990s,” (Kallen, 2014, p. 5). What caused the outbreak of K-Pop (or Korean pop) and Korean Break dancing was the Hallyu or Korean wave where Korea would export numerous Korean music and Korean drama to the world through multimedia platforms such as television and the internet (Kallen, 2014, p. 31). Everything was connected, in other words if someone loved to watch Korean drama he or she would also be exposed to K-Pop or Korean culture. K-Pop and break dancing (or B-boying) are two famous dance forms in the world. Like American pop and break dancing, K-pop and break dancing heavily relies on its music. K-pop and break dancing also take inspirations from other cultures from Manhattans break dancing to Capoeira martial arts. Especially K-pop which uses catchy beats and English lyrics in songs like “Gangnam Style”, “Tell me”, and “Gee,”. In other words, there’s no way to talk about K-pop dancing without mentioning its song and music. The paper focuses on tracing back to the origins and history of Korean K-Pop and break dancing, how western media influences and promotes Korean K-pop and break-dancing, why it’s so popular today and the different dance forms or movements in K-pop and Korean break dancing. 
	The origins of K-Pop originate back to the 1950’s when the Korean War was fought, American soldiers introduced American music to the Koreans such as Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry (Kallen, 2014, p. 5). The Korean government tried to put a ban on the rock and roll music deeming it immoral however, American music flourished and inspired new rock stars in the 1960’s. In the 1960’s, one of the founding fathers of Korean rock was Shin Joong-hyun also known as Jackie Shin (p. 6). Unfortunately, Jackie Shin faced opposition from the Korean government putting a ban on his music and by the time the ban was lifted Korean’s taste in music changed to ballads and bubblegum music (p. 7-8). In 1972, go-go clubs (kogojang in Korean) were on the rise in Korea and many Koreans would go to these clubs purely to dance with the music (Kim & Choe, 2014, p. 283-284). In 1985, Lee Soo-man would become the man that would introduce K-pop to South Koreans thanks to influence from pop music on MTV from the United States. He would create his recording company called SM Entertainment in 1988 to help train and produce some of the biggest K-pop stars in Korea (Kallen, 2014, p 9). In 1992, Lee Soo-man would then help Seo Taiji, Yang Hyun-suk and Lee Juno into creating a band called “Seo Taiji & Boys,” (p. 10). 
Seo Taiji and the Boys would use a dance form called “formation changing,” which consisted of jumping, kicking and arm thrusts (Kallen, 2014, p.11). One example of their dance is their song “I know,” where they play on stage in front of a huge crowd in 1992. All three band members would dance in synchronization with fist pumps, poses while crossing their arms, and wild kicks and jumps. The band appears to focus more on their singing and wild movements than special dance moves (MBCfestival, 2012). Soon other Korean pop stars imitated their formation changing dances and their music would criticize the South Korean society and school system which would attract fans in Korea and Japan (Kallen, 2014, p. 11). Seo Taiji and the Boys would focus heavily on dances, for example Seo would do the singing while two members of the group would perform dance solos (Kim & Choe, 2014, p. 298). They would also put in b-boy (break dancing) dance routines into their songs while wearing clothes that matched with the dancing (Kim & Choe, 2014, p. 300). 
Lee Soo-man would often play music in clubs and study his audience by finding what song drove people to get up and dance. Then he would proceed to go back to SM Entertainment and produce songs similar to the dance clubs that drove people to dance. Lee Soo-man would then hire fresh new talents in singer and dancers all over Korea, Japan and America to create the next set of pop stars (Kallen, 2014, p. 17-18). In fact, Lee Soo-man would pretty much gamble on dance music due to the lack of publicity dance music had in Korea (Shin & Kim, 2013, 263) Lee Soo-Man would eventually create a group called H.O.T., an organization of K-Pop Bands that were popular in Korea. The group was successful in selling thousands of copies, create “precisely arranged dance moves, (Kallen, 2014, p. 18-19)” and choose sensitive topics on modern issues such as bullying. 
In 2000, Korea would soon spread the “Hallyu,” or “Korean Wave,” by exporting Korean TV Drama and K-Pop music to the entire world. People all over the world would listen or follow famous Korean K-Pop stars such as Super Junior, Girls’ Generation and Rain (Kallen, 2014, p. 31). For example, in 2007, an all-girl group called the Wonder Girls, created “Tell Me,” a music video with catchy song, techno beats and special dance moves. This would eventually create copycat videos and parodies of “Tell Me,” making it K-pops template for music and dancing (Lie, 2014, p. 133). However, one such idol would stand out in the world. That idol would be Psy from “Gangnam style,” in 2012, the song broke records in the United States and the world record (p. 43). In the video “Gangnam Style,” Psy uses his famous signature move called the horse trot dance at different parts in the video. Although the music video takes more interest of Psy at different locations he does occasionally use his hand to perform a lasso rope movement while performing the horse trot. Other times the dancers would shake their hips and with drag their feet across the ground or have the males go under the female dancers while they perform the horse trot. In total the video is bizarre and weird but with its English lyrics “Hey sexy Lady,” and horse trot dance the video makes it interesting and catchy for a lot of listeners (officialpsy, 2012). 
In the beginning people in Korea disliked his music due to its sensitive nature his song posed and the “jerky dance moves” he performed on national television (Lie, 2014, p. 45). Psy would then create one of the most famous dance move in “Gangnam Style,” by using the horse trot dance movement instead of the panda and kangaroo dance forms (p. 47). In fact, Lee Ju-sun the dance choreographer of “Gangnam Style,” received a car as a gift from Psy (Tudor, 2014, p. 370). This happens often in new K-pop songs, choreographers would make a “point dance,” a special dance based off a special concept so that it can become more famous and catchy. For example, besides Psy’s horse dance other dances forms such as the eongdeongi-chum (English literal translation of “butt”) or the “butt dance,” makes it way first in the initial plan then the concept of the song to match the dance (p. 339). Such as the music video “Mr.” from the all-girl group KARA. According to Lie, John (2014) point dances are “signature gestures or dance steps as the performers produce kinetic equivalents of lyrical refrains,” (Lie, 2014, p. 181). 
Another example why dance choreography is important in K-pop is from Yoo Young-Jin a composer for SM Entertainment who explains the importance of dance in song: “There is a beginning-to-end flow in a dance routine, just as there is in a song, (Kang, 2010),” (Fuhr, 2016, p. 82). According to Kim, Youna (2013), a new generation of “dance trackers,” have emerged from the K-pop world. “Dance trackers,” are fans that would seek more of the dance movements of K-pop music videos than the music itself. These “dance trackers,” would try to imitate and duplicate the dance choreographies of their favorite K-pop group. With today’s media and technology people can go on YouTube to find tutorials from K-pop groups teaching how to dance to their songs with unedited videos without the flashy animations and film cuts. Other YouTube channels and websites would post K-pop dance covers with discussions in the comments leading people to inspire to dance like their favorite K-pop stars (Kim, 2013, p. 169-170). A lot of tutorial videos will involve “mirror dancing,” where the viewer can dance with the video as if they were looking into a mirror (p. 172). According to Using catchy music, beats or dance movements makes K-Pop attractive to even non-Korean listeners making it the reason why “Gangnam style,” so popular today by catching people’s attention with easy to remember lyrics and dance movements (Lie, 2014, p. 195). With new bands entering the K-Pop world, Korean music continues to spread all over the glove with its special dance choreography and fashionable clothes (Kallen, 2014, p. 54). 
	According to the Korean Journal of Neurotrauma, break-dancing (or b-boying) was a term from a disc jockey from South Bronx in the New York City in the 1970s. Dancers were called b-boys or b-girls that would dance to the hip-hop music (Hu, Choi & Son, 2015, p. 183). It was introduced to Koreans in the 1980’s by the American soldiers stationed in Korea but it technically took off in Korea during 1997. What inspired the Korean B-boy culture was a video from John Jay Chon from America. John Jay Chon gave a tape of a Los Angeles break dance contest to members of the Expression Crew, a dance group who would help spread the culture of break-dancing (Tudor, 2014, p. 350). In fact, when John Jay came back to Korea he discovered that the same video he gave to the Expression crew was copied over one hundred times and spread to different dance circles (The Christian Science Monitor, 2011). Five years later the same Expression Crew competed in the international “Battle of the Year,” a contest where break dancers all over the world compete against each other. They would end up winning the contest and soon Korean dance crews such as the Gamblerz, Morning of Owl, and Extreme Crew would win competition multiple times. The Extreme Crew has also been noted for creating the musical dance called “The Ballerina Who Loved a B-Boy,” which contains ballet, break-dancing and no speaking. Others would also try to incorporate Taekwondo, a Korean martial art with break-dancing (Tudor, 2014, p. 350). 
After winning competitions in break-dancing, the South Korean government took interest in the dancing by promoting their own break-dancing competition in Korea. The Korean Tourism Organization would host the “R16 World B-Boy Championships,” (The Christian Science Monitor, 2011). Break-dancing with its acrobatic moves made its way into K-pop music videos in the 1990s. Standard K-pop dance moves normally relied on simple movements such as the contagion and grapevine dance moves (Lie, 2014, p. 132). The break dancing style from the group Gamblerz Crew in Korea were once controversial due to their over exaggerated power moves however due to this they created a type of “New School,” in Korea (Johnson, 2011, p. 176). Unfortunately, many people believe that nationality played a huge role in determining the winner in competitions. People would also claim that the Korean and Japanese dance crews are the “Yellow peril,” or the invasion of Asians in the top rankings. These people would also make stereotypes of Asians saying that Asian dance crews don’t have passion in their dancing because they always try too perfect or excel at everything (p. 182). 
Another issue with break dancing in Korea is large amount of case reports and injuries associated with break dancing. According to the Korean Journal of Neurotrauma, “95% of 42 study subjects experienced musculoskeletal injuries” in the wrist, fingers and knees making break dancing a “high-risk dancing sport,” (Hu, Choi & Son, 2015, p. 183). Injuries are more commonly found within the amateurs as they have no access to professional support in instructions and screening. Even simple break dancing moves such as the top rocker, up rock and freeze can cause strain and stress on the wrist (p. 183-184). 
	Western media plays a huge role in influencing K-pop and break dancing. For example, the release of the MTV show in the United States influenced Lee Soo-man into learn from the bubblegum pop and metal bands on MTV (Kallen, 2014, p. 9). Seo Taiji was also influenced by American hip-hop around the 1990s (p. 10). Kwon Boa or BoA was heavily influenced by American hip-hop and R&B from American singers Janet Jackson and Nelly in her new album called ID; Peace B which sold out 220 thousand copies in Korea (p. 27). Around the year 2005, second generation K-pop stars saw their songs spread across other countries in Asia, America and Europe. With the help of online music stores such as iTunes and social media websites such as Facebook and YouTube made exposure for K-pop stars all over the world (p. 30). Another singer that was influenced by western media was Jung Ji-hoon or Bii who watched MTV in Korea while trying to learn the dance moves of Michael Jackson (p. 31). 
All the K-pop stars would all dwarf to Psy’s success who took Western music videos as his passion. For example, he was so obsessed in British rock band “Queen,” that he would ignore his studies and would talk to his parents into attending school in the United States (Kallen, 2014, p. 44). He would also fall in love in music from Tupac, Eminem and Snoop Dogg (p.45). In an interview with Daniel Tudor, Psy stated that Freddie Mercury from Queen was his role model and idol in fact he was the only idol that made him love music and that when Freddie Mercury died he wanted to attend his tribute concert at Wembley Stadium (Tudor, 2014, p. 373) According to Michael Fuhr (2016) it’s all thanks to the internet and social networking services that K-pop is spreading to places like Germany. Fuhr says that on his own experience in Germany he met some German girls dancing to K-pop despite not knowing the Korean culture, language or interest. They would meet up regularly and practice dancing to the K-pop videos despite the fact that Korea hasn’t officially brought in K-pop into Germany (Fuhr, 2016, p. 5). Western media such as YouTube brings in different tutorials and demonstrations of K-pop dances where people can learn to dance through “mirror dancing,” (Kim, 2013, p. 172). One example of this is the YouTube channel called “mirrorHD” where a group of Korean dancers would perform the dance of famous K-pop music videos and people could dance with them as if they were looking into a mirror. In the video “Psy – Gangnam Style mirrored Dance Practice,” the dancers would dance in a large group with a mix of an equivalent number of men and women. The singer that looks like Psy would take the middle and sing while the dancers would dance behind him. The dancers would use dances from the music video Gangnam Style where the females would dance first, then the males and then everyone dances together by the time the video is over. The dance moves aren’t too complicated and are just like it says “mirrored,” amateurs can dance with the video as if they were looking into a mirror (mirrorHD, 2012). 
	There are plenty of reason why Koreans fell in love with B-boying (break-dancing). According to Daniel Tudor, in an interview members of Expression Crew stated that break dancing was a way to escape the pressure and stress that the Koreas strict society and education brought among the younger generation. Ironically enough this is what brought the Expression crew and other Korean break-dancing group to achieve first place in international break-dancing competitions (Tudor, 2014, p. 351). What probably brought American hip-hop and break dancing into Korea was the freedom of expression that it presented to the Korean dancers. The society in Korea was strict with education and family values being first before dancing and music. American hip-hop and break dancing gave another option for Korean teenagers and students to get away from the strict society. This was the case for a lot of Korean singers, they felt K-pop was a way to rebel against the strict society that Korea had on the younger generation where education and culture were more important than hip-hop. Singers like Seo Taiji and the Boys would pick topics in their songs that would go against the oppressive government and Korean culture which gained lots of fans in Korea and Japan (Kallen, 2014, p. 11). Thanks to the Hallyu wave across the world fans were able to see their favorite K-pop stars online allowing a large number of teenage followers (Kim, 2013, p. 169). Another factor that makes K-pop and break dancing so attractive is the fashion and trademarks of K-pop such as the short sleeve tuxedos with bare abs for the males and the sexy long legs with short pants for the females (p.171). Some fans K-pop fans take it to the limit to make learning K-pop dances their hobbies. For example, a Eurasian fan in the United Kingdom took one day to film her reproduction of a K-pop dance (p. 172). In total, K-pop and Korean breakdancing was also another way to give thanks to America for the creative freedom it brought to the older generations in Korea. 
	The different dance moves that Koreans used in break dancing are similar to the ones used in America. For example, in the video “Gayageum on Pachelvel’s Canon: Hip Hop & Beatbox,” the lone b-boy dancer is dancing to the music from a Gayageum, a traditional Korean string instrument and a beatboxer and DJ playing in the background. In the beginning of the song the Korean dancer makes a few top rock dance moves to signify the intro of the song. Then after a few top rock moves the dancer moves into some floor rock and freezes where the dancer would do handstands on his hands or elbows while his feet are in the air making poses and different times (The Ad Show, 2011). Another American dance moves makes its mark in the Korean video as the dancer does a few windmill moves which originated from Manhattan from a man called Crazy Legs or Richie Colon who invented it in the 1980s (Rajakumar, 2012, p. 35). Even influences from Capoeira a Brazilian martial art is found inside the video as the dancer makes small head-spins near the end of the video (p. 25). Break dancers do have their own set of dance moves that originate from different places but it’s how they combine it all together that creates the break dancing that we know today. America invented break dancing and the Koreans perfected it. 
	K-Pop also has its own set of dance moves that are either original or taken from other Korean dancers. For example, in the music video “Gentleman,” played by Psy, uses the “Arrogant dance,” which originally came from the music video “Abracadabra,” played by an all-girl-group called the Brown Eyed Girls in 2009. The “Arrogant dance,” consists of dancers standing in one spot while shaking their hips and making various poses with their arms that would be either in the air or on their chin imitating that they’re thinking of something (BuzzFeedVideo, 2014). The song “Mr.” from the group KARA’s swing their hips during one part of the lyrics (Lie, 2014, p. 181). For example, in the song “Mr.” from the all-girl group KARA they created the first use of the famous “butt dance” in their music video. In the music video the five girls are wearing long baggy pants with sneakers, t-shirt revealing their belly and fashionable gloves. The girls do their famous butt dance by swinging their hips in an exaggerated move and their hands in the air so that they can show their belly (KARA, 2013). The clothing and dance that the KARA group performs is almost similar to a belly dancer. A good example is from the “Queen of the Pyramid,” competition by Dovile from Lithuania. In the video she wears a bikini top, a long baggy skirt and no shoes. She uses her hips to move and shake her butt and belly while her arms are sometimes in the air to show off her belly (Dovile, 2011). One could make the assumption that the KARA group or choreographers got the idea of the “butt dance” from the famous belly dancers due to the striking similarities. 
	Songs such “Gee, gee, gee,” from Girls Generation use the crab dance in their video (Lie, 2014, p. 181). The nine girls in the music video are all wearing high heels, tight jeans and different t-shirts. The choice of clothing unlike the clothes from “Mr.” from KARA limits the dance moves in the music video Gee by the Girls Generation. When performing the crab dance the girls don’t make too many aggressive dance moves with their legs. The music video instead focuses heavily on the synchronization, hand and arm movements. For example, when the song lyrics mention “can’t sleep at night,” the girls in the video would put their hands together and rest their head on their hands imitating that they’re sleeping. The synchronization is amazing as shown at 2:48 where the girls would stop dancing and then in a split second strike a pose pointing to their right as every girl in line would do it in order to imitate something like the wave (Girls Generation, 2009). After studying the dance from “Gee,” it may look simple at first because it appears as if the girls are repeating the same dance moves but in reality the dance looks a lot harder than it looks making it quite popular among dancers.
	K-pop also has their own formations that are similar to other dances in Korea. For example, in the YouTube video “Kpop Dances That Are Easier Than People Think,” shows various montage clips from dance covers by amateurs. As faithful as the dance covers are they do show the number of different dance formations K-pop artists use in their music videos. K-pop stars are usually all-boy or all-girl bands and may consist of three to twenty dancers in a band. The group would usually dance in a V formation with the lead singer in the front of the video. Other times the group would dance in W formations to two lines but always with spacing so that the audience can see the face of all the dancers. One particular observation is that the lead singer always shares the spotlight with other singers by switching places when changing formations or after singing their part of the lyrics. In other words, formations are important because it gives a chance for each band member to shine on stage and keep the whole band together (파아파, 2015).  
	In the beginning Korea was still being introduced to famous songs from Elvis Presley and rock and roll. It wasn’t until decades later when K-pop and Korean breakdancing started gaining popularity in Asia. It wasn’t until the “Hallyu” or “Korean wave” where Korean culture spread all over the globe thanks to multimedia platforms such as the television and internet. With different dance moves and style, K-pop and break dancing has been popular among all ages all over the world. The paper talked about the history of K-pop and Korean break dancing, how multimedia platforms such as YouTube influence and spreads K-pop and break dancing, why it’s so popular with different age groups and the type of different dance moves in K-pop and Korean break dancing. Korean K-pop and break dancing is more than a sensation, it’s a growing culture of Korea that continues to spread all over the world thanks to the past influence of the older generation and the new generation of people that use the internet.
