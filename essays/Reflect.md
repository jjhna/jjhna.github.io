E11: Reflect on smart questions

Opinion:

In my opinion as much as I agree on Eric Raymond view on asking smart questions I also believe on smart answers when replying to these smart questions. For example, in this smart question by Deepankar Bajpeyi: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19316937/how-to-bind-bootstrap-datepicker-element-with-angularjs-ng-model the top answer he receives are very thought out and explains the solution in a few short sentences. However, if you were to scroll down you see most the answers to be quite broad and long. So even though I agree with smart questions, if you also give a stupid answer it negates the effort of the person to ask a smart question. 

Observation: Smart question

Going back to Deepankar’s post he asks a simple question for his title post making it clear what he’s asking for. The question isn’t on par with the smarter section but mostly smart section. Here are some of the good points:

1.	It’s a smart question

2.	It’s on topic

3.	The post is written with little or no spelling and grammar errors

4.	Did a google search of the question, had a difficult time finding the answer making this question exceptional to the rule “Before You Ask”.

5.	It has a meaningful header

6.	Question is descriptive and using good format with a separate gray box for coding. 

7.	Short and to the point, it’s just one paragraph long with additional short questions that further explain the question.

Deepanakar asks a smart question and because of this he receives smart intelligent responses that helps him with his program.

Observation: Dumb question

On the other hand I did find a lot of bad questions in StackOverflow. For example these two questions by Bar Shema: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41784940/google-in-app-purches-policy is a good example of bad question. 

For Bar Shema some of the bad points are:

1.	A bad header, his header for his post is generic and isn’t even a question at all.

2.	His first statement that he hopes that this is right place to ask, making it a bad post. 

3.	This question could be possibly found using google search.

4.	The question is more suited towards google forums than stackoverflow.

5.	Bad spelling errors in the header.

It seems that Bar Shema is confused on where to put this post and it’s about google policy which would work best at a google forum Q & A page than stackoverflow. This is also not a coding problem but a policy question. Bar Shema also should’ve stated his header as a question and check for spelling errors. A good tip would’ve been to use Microsoft word to type it in for spelling and grammar. 

Conclusion:

I now recognize the difference between a smart and not smart question. This lesson did help me in improving myself to think twice before posting a question and use the tips given by Eric Raymond on asking questions the smart way. By doing so, I should receive smart answers and avoid being shunned by the internet community.
